# Marzipano Test with RICOH THETA Images

This is a virtual tour demo of RICOH THETA images 
built using the 
[Marzipano Tool](https://www.marzipano.net/).

The character is inserted into the 360 image using the 
[RICOH THETA SC Type Hatsune Miku camera and app](https://community.theta360.guide/t/hands-on-review-of-ricoh-theta-sc-type-hatsune-miku-camera-and-app/2591?u=craig).  This
was a special edition RICOH THETA SC that I used for
evaluation of the impressive software that was built for the 
camera.
